Data analysis|Exploratory data analysis (EDA)||Data preprocessing||Descriptive statistics

In this project, we are examining the California dataset to address the following inquiries:

1. What is the average median income of the data set and check the distribution of data using appropriate plots. Please explain the distribution of the plot.
2. Draw an appropriate plot to see the distribution of housing_median_age and explain your observations.
3. Show with the help of visualization, how median_income and median_house_values are related?
4. Create a data set by deleting the corresponding examples from the data set for which total_bedrooms are not available.
5. Create a data set by filling the missing data with the mean value of the total_bedrooms in the original data set.
6. Write a programming construct (create a user defined function) to calculate the median value of the data set wherever required.
7. Plot latitude versus longitude and explain your observations.
